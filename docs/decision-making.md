# How to set up decision making

Set up a structure for accountability

- Start with clear titles, or at least pick a CEO
- Clear areas of ownership: who is the final decision maker?
- What happens if someone disagrees slightly versus stringly?

Once you've made your decision, at some point you need to check back in to see how that decision played out, and whether anything needs to change in the process moving forward.

A concensus where everyone makes a final decision is tricky and can be avoided with a designated final accountable person or decision maker
