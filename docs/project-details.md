# Project Details

## Description

Customizable financial analysis application with easy vs clear design

## Goals and deliverables

1. Re-build the code infrastructure to support hard and soft filters for any subject

2. Experiment with some subset of users to see if the customizable filters positively impact users.

3. Ship it!

## Ownership

If we decide not to work together at the conclusion of the project, the assets
produced during the duration of the project belong to:

Analytica Labs will receive ownership of all the code that Meek M. and Mathew O. write.

Bad reasons to split equity unequally

- "I came up with the idea"
- "I started working on the idea 6 months before my co-founder"
- "My co-founder took a salary for a while and I didn't"
- "I am older and more experienced than my co-founder"
- "We need someone to tie-break in arguments"
- "I launched my MVP without my co-founder"
- "My co-founder agreed to their smaller share"
- "I raised thousands of dollars without my co-founder"
