# Evaluating co-founder compatibility

Ways to evaluate sompatibility with your co-founder

- Goals & values
- Stress
- Communication
- Finances
- Commitment
- Meet in person

Complementary skills can be learned. They are not necessary when evaluating a compatible co-founder.

Less important:

- Complementary skills i.e. "Someone that can fundraise to help bring potential investors and experienced board members"

Exceptions:

- Non-techinical founders need a technical founder, paying for a dev shop will not work in replacement for an engineer in the beginning.
