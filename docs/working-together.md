# How to work together

Communications channels must be set up before starting to working together

A few topics to discuss with your co-founder

- Do you get frustrated when a project has no traction?
- How long can you go with little to no a salary or benefits?
- How much to work on your startup?
- What does 'being available' & 'response times' look like? ex. If I slack you and you respond 6 hours later, will that be an issue
- What milestones need to be reached for everyone to stay motivated?

Trust allows a functional relationship to thrive

How to trust

- Trust people by default
- If you say you'll do something, do it
- Create space for mistakes, never say "I told you so"
- Spend time together in person
