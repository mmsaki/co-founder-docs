# Finding a co-founder

Co-founders can be classmates, co-leagues, friends or family members and people who would be fun to work with

Reccomend asking yourself

- Are you technical
- Do you have an idea you're working on or are you open to new ideas?
- How many hours a week are you willing to commit?
- What industries are you interested in?
- Can you be responsible for engineering, sales, product, etc?

Tips on matching with a co-founder:

- Create a complete profile about what you are passionate about
- Sometimes making a video can give better impression on your commitement
- Someone cultures value humility, however, this is the time to brag about your achievement
- Keep your score on what you've done front and center for everyone to see
- Meet as soon as possible or not at all

If you see someone that you feel could make a good match, start a project with them. Bonus if they agree to start a project with you on the weekend.
