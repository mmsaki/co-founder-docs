# Co-founder

A co-founder is someone who starts your start-up with you. Usually someone who
is there from the begining.

Sometimes a co-founder is someone with at least 10% of equity in the startup.

## Why do you need a cofounder

A co-founder is important for the following reasons:

- Productivity - Higher quality & quantity of work accountability
  - Moving fast is critical growing a startup
  - Two people can accomplish twice as much work
  - Higher quality brainstorming by using each other's resources
  - Easy to avoid bad ideas by having a co-founder
  - Knowing you have someone the next day to check progress is effective
- Moral Support
  - Someone to be there through through the ups and downs

A startup is a very defficult journey for anyone and doing it alone makes it
more than twice as hard.
