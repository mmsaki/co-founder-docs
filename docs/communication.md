# Personality and communication styles

Keep an eye on each other's mental health i.e. are noticing your co-founder burning out? are they taking care of themselves? are they becoming more reactive or more emotional.

- Know how your co-founder reacts when they're under stress. Do they attack or retreat when having a tough conversation?
- Does your co-founder speak up when they see a problem, or do they bottle it up?
- What environments are most confortable for your co-founder to voice concerns?
- Are you both comfortable praising each other or celebrating each other's wins?
- Will you feel attacked if your co-founder makes a suggestion about your work?
